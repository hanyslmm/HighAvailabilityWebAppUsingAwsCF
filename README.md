# High Availability Web App Using AWS CloudFormation

This is a realistic scenario where we deploy an application (Apache Web Server) and also pick up code (JavaScript and HTML) from S3 Storage and deploy it in the appropriate folder on the web server.

## There will be two parts to this project:

1- Develop a diagram that is a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script.

2- Interpret the instructions & diagram to create a matching CloudFormation script.


## Task description:

Your company is creating an Instagram clone called Udagram. Developers pushed the latest version of their code in a zip file located in a public S3 Bucket.

You have been tasked with deploying the application, along with the necessary supporting software into its matching infrastructure.

This needs to be done in an automated fashion so that the infrastructure can be discarded as soon as the testing team finishes their tests and gathers their results.
