# High Availability Web App Using AWS CloudFormation

This is a realistic scenario where we deploy an application (Apache Web Server) and also pick up code (JavaScript and HTML) from S3 Storage and deploy it in the appropriate folder on the web server.

## There will be two parts to this project:

1- Develop a diagram that is a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script.

2- Interpret the instructions & diagram to create a matching CloudFormation script.
